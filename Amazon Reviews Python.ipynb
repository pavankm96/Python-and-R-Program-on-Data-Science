I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it.

My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance.

My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance.

I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it. It's really good deal I got.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Picture quality is best and auto focus is perfect too, but one advice if you are looking for video recording go for sony camera in same price you'll be getting 4K instead of 1080p, over all 77D is best for portrait, landscape, vlogging and daily use. But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n\",\n",

My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance.

I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it. It's really good deal I got.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Picture quality is best and auto focus is perfect too, but one advice if you are looking for video recording go for sony camera in same price you'll be getting 4K instead of 1080p, over all 77D is best for portrait, landscape, vlogging and daily use. But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just great\\n\\n \\n\\n  This a brilliant piece of equipment. Better than 80d as this has digic 7 and couple other things. This camera will fullfil all your basic photographic needs. Its sharp, Autofocus is brilliant. And if you are in confusion regarding this and sony A6300, put that sony thing in garbage. That camera is good for nothing. My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance. This camera will never disappoint you if you combine it with nice lenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first dslr and needed a good camera to replace my smartphone. I initially was considering the 200d(SL2) or panasonic G85. After much research for days I stumbled upon this camera as it is considered the younger brother of the canon 80d. I'm so glad I choose this. The picture quality is amazing and video though not 4K,  is very sharp and clear. Autofocus is awesome and battery life is pretty good. Still exploring the camera after a week.Great camera for those who want something more than the entry level cameras\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the camera kit today. All present in the box, as listed. Will review after a while of use, with added lenses & accessories.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It's been a month since I'm using this camera, if you're a beginner like me,  go ahead and give it a try.Also,  if you don't really want to shoot sports or wildlife you can go for a relatively cheap camera coz the cost is mainly for its no of focus points.You would also get same specifications in 800D except that top LCD screen and rotating gears on top and back of camera body,  I don't think LCD is much of any use if you're a beginner as most of the times you would find yourself shooting in live view.Overall it's a great camera if you want to go for sports and wildlife, for fashion and street photography you can look for some cheaper cameras from canon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it for 55k after discount.

But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just great\\n\\n \\n\\n  This a brilliant piece of equipment. Better than 80d as this has digic 7 and couple other things. This camera will fullfil all your basic photographic needs. Its sharp, Autofocus is brilliant. And if you are in confusion regarding this and sony A6300, put that sony thing in garbage. That camera is good for nothing. My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance. This camera will never disappoint you if you combine it with nice lenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first dslr and needed a good camera to replace my smartphone. I initially was considering the 200d(SL2) or panasonic G85. After much research for days I stumbled upon this camera as it is considered the younger brother of the canon 80d. I'm so glad I choose this. The picture quality is amazing and video though not 4K,  is very sharp and clear. Autofocus is awesome and battery life is pretty good. Still exploring the camera after a week.Great camera for those who want something more than the entry level cameras\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the camera kit today. All present in the box, as listed. Will review after a while of use, with added lenses & accessories.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It's been a month since I'm using this camera, if you're a beginner like me,  go ahead and give it a try.Also,  if you don't really want to shoot sports or wildlife you can go for a relatively cheap camera coz the cost is mainly for its no of focus points.You would also get same specifications in 800D except that top LCD screen and rotating gears on top and back of camera body,  I don't think LCD is much of any use if you're a beginner as most of the times you would find yourself shooting in live view.Overall it's a great camera if you want to go for sports and wildlife, for fashion and street photography you can look for some cheaper cameras from canon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it for 55k after discount. Got 1k payback in amazon pay upon delivery. Package was solid, thanks to Appario Pvt Ltd. Got it early during festive season.

And if you are in confusion regarding this and sony A6300, put that sony thing in garbage. That camera is good for nothing. My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance. This camera will never disappoint you if you combine it with nice lenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first dslr and needed a good camera to replace my smartphone. I initially was considering the 200d(SL2) or panasonic G85. After much research for days I stumbled upon this camera as it is considered the younger brother of the canon 80d. I'm so glad I choose this. The picture quality is amazing and video though not 4K,  is very sharp and clear. Autofocus is awesome and battery life is pretty good. Still exploring the camera after a week.Great camera for those who want something more than the entry level cameras\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the camera kit today. All present in the box, as listed. Will review after a while of use, with added lenses & accessories.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It's been a month since I'm using this camera, if you're a beginner like me,  go ahead and give it a try.Also,  if you don't really want to shoot sports or wildlife you can go for a relatively cheap camera coz the cost is mainly for its no of focus points.You would also get same specifications in 800D except that top LCD screen and rotating gears on top and back of camera body,  I don't think LCD is much of any use if you're a beginner as most of the times you would find yourself shooting in live view.Overall it's a great camera if you want to go for sports and wildlife, for fashion and street photography you can look for some cheaper cameras from canon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it for 55k after discount. Got 1k payback in amazon pay upon delivery. Package was solid, thanks to Appario Pvt Ltd. Got it early during festive season. Package includes camera body with 18-55 lens, charger and battery, 16gb class 10 uhs1 San disk ultra SD card, camera bag. Camera is great so far.

Best mid range dslr camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  Before buying this camera I did lot of research, I am at very beginner level of photography. The good feature I liked about video shooting with dual auto focus. this is very cool features, It gives picture quality like cinematography. Really amazing, apart from video quality picture quality is awesome. Still I am learning to shoot photos in manual mode abut overall amazing product. I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it. It's really good deal I got.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Picture quality is best and auto focus is perfect too, but one advice if you are looking for video recording go for sony camera in same price you'll be getting 4K instead of 1080p, over all 77D is best for portrait, landscape, vlogging and daily use. But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just great\\n\\n \\n\\n  This a brilliant piece of equipment.

This camera will never disappoint you if you combine it with nice lenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first dslr and needed a good camera to replace my smartphone. I initially was considering the 200d(SL2) or panasonic G85. After much research for days I stumbled upon this camera as it is considered the younger brother of the canon 80d. I'm so glad I choose this. The picture quality is amazing and video though not 4K,  is very sharp and clear. Autofocus is awesome and battery life is pretty good. Still exploring the camera after a week.Great camera for those who want something more than the entry level cameras\\n\\n \\n\\n  Received the camera kit today. All present in the box, as listed. Will review after a while of use, with added lenses & accessories.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It's been a month since I'm using this camera, if you're a beginner like me,  go ahead and give it a try.Also,  if you don't really want to shoot sports or wildlife you can go for a relatively cheap camera coz the cost is mainly for its no of focus points.You would also get same specifications in 800D except that top LCD screen and rotating gears on top and back of camera body,  I don't think LCD is much of any use if you're a beginner as most of the times you would find yourself shooting in live view.Overall it's a great camera if you want to go for sports and wildlife, for fashion and street photography you can look for some cheaper cameras from canon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it for 55k after discount. Got 1k payback in amazon pay upon delivery. Package was solid, thanks to Appario Pvt Ltd. Got it early during festive season. Package includes camera body with 18-55 lens, charger and battery, 16gb class 10 uhs1 San disk ultra SD card, camera bag. Camera is great so far. Great purchase overall.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This DSLR is worth every money spent its excellent in its price range  and ty appario retail private ltd for it was carefully packed and the product i got was in excellent condition pictures  quality is amazing and auto focus is awesome especially during videography\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. Nice product2. Too late delivery(reached 10days after promised final date of delivery)3. Good packing4. Efs18-55mm f4-5.6 lens is average. poor quality on low light.(feels like used one)5. Had issues with warranty registration, but solved it by contacting canon.(got 1+1year warranty for body and lens.)6. Package includes: EOS 77D Body, EF-S 18-55mm 4-5.6 IS STM, Lens Cap, Battery Pack, Battery Charger, Eye Cup,camera strap,camera bag, 16gb SD card.7. Worth for money (49800-offer.  please dont think second time if u found an offer like this.)8. Best mid range dslr camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  Before buying this camera I did lot of research, I am at very beginner level of photography. The good feature I liked about video shooting with dual auto focus. this is very cool features, It gives picture quality like cinematography. Really amazing, apart from video quality picture quality is awesome. Still I am learning to shoot photos in manual mode abut overall amazing product. I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it. It's really good deal I got.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Picture quality is best and auto focus is perfect too, but one advice if you are looking for video recording go for sony camera in same price you'll be getting 4K instead of 1080p, over all 77D is best for portrait, landscape, vlogging and daily use. But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just great\\n\\n \\n\\n  This a brilliant piece of equipment. Better than 80d as this has digic 7 and couple other things. This camera will fullfil all your basic photographic needs. Its sharp, Autofocus is brilliant. And if you are in confusion regarding this and sony A6300, put that sony thing in garbage. That camera is good for nothing. My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels.

Will review after a while of use, with added lenses & accessories.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It's been a month since I'm using this camera, if you're a beginner like me,  go ahead and give it a try.Also,  if you don't really want to shoot sports or wildlife you can go for a relatively cheap camera coz the cost is mainly for its no of focus points.You would also get same specifications in 800D except that top LCD screen and rotating gears on top and back of camera body,  I don't think LCD is much of any use if you're a beginner as most of the times you would find yourself shooting in live view.Overall it's a great camera if you want to go for sports and wildlife, for fashion and street photography you can look for some cheaper cameras from canon.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got it for 55k after discount. Got 1k payback in amazon pay upon delivery. Package was solid, thanks to Appario Pvt Ltd. Got it early during festive season. Package includes camera body with 18-55 lens, charger and battery, 16gb class 10 uhs1 San disk ultra SD card, camera bag. Camera is great so far. Great purchase overall.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This DSLR is worth every money spent its excellent in its price range  and ty appario retail private ltd for it was carefully packed and the product i got was in excellent condition pictures  quality is amazing and auto focus is awesome especially during videography\\n\\n \\n\\n  1. Nice product2. Too late delivery(reached 10days after promised final date of delivery)3. Good packing4. Efs18-55mm f4-5.6 lens is average. poor quality on low light.(feels like used one)5. Had issues with warranty registration, but solved it by contacting canon.(got 1+1year warranty for body and lens.)6. Package includes: EOS 77D Body, EF-S 18-55mm 4-5.6 IS STM, Lens Cap, Battery Pack, Battery Charger, Eye Cup,camera strap,camera bag, 16gb SD card.7. Worth for money (49800-offer.  please dont think second time if u found an offer like this.)8. Best mid range dslr camera\\n\\n \\n\\n  Before buying this camera I did lot of research, I am at very beginner level of photography. The good feature I liked about video shooting with dual auto focus. this is very cool features, It gives picture quality like cinematography. Really amazing, apart from video quality picture quality is awesome. Still I am learning to shoot photos in manual mode abut overall amazing product. I did bought this camera from Amazon at Rs. 49,000. this is not usual price available on amazon, but one day I was just looking price range and saw this price, without second thought I bought it. It's really good deal I got.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Picture quality is best and auto focus is perfect too, but one advice if you are looking for video recording go for sony camera in same price you'll be getting 4K instead of 1080p, over all 77D is best for portrait, landscape, vlogging and daily use. But purchase with 18-135mm lens and one addition prime lens of canon 50mm f1.8 for portrait and low light photography.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Just great\\n\\n \\n\\n  This a brilliant piece of equipment. Better than 80d as this has digic 7 and couple other things. This camera will fullfil all your basic photographic needs. Its sharp, Autofocus is brilliant. And if you are in confusion regarding this and sony A6300, put that sony thing in garbage. That camera is good for nothing. My brother has it and its inferior to canon 77d on so many levels. My brother regrets buying it.  Sony may be a little better in terms of videos as sony 4k and all but like who buys a camera with their first priority as for video.... for many enthusiast photographers like me Videos are of a secondary importance. This camera will never disappoint you if you combine it with nice lenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This is my first dslr and needed a good camera to replace my smartphone. I initially was considering the 200d(SL2) or panasonic G85. After much research for days I stumbled upon this camera as it is considered the younger brother of the canon 80d. I'm so glad I choose this. The picture quality is amazing and video though not 4K,  is very sharp and clear. Autofocus is awesome and battery life is pretty good.
